            <p> 
                Often called the "Betawi omelette," Kerak Telor is a legendary snack from Jakarta.
                It's made from sticky rice cooked with chicken or duck eggs, then topped with fried shallots, shredded coconut, and dried shrimp.
                Cooked over charcoal, it has a unique crispy texture and a savory, slightly sweet flavor that truly represents Jakarta's culinary heritage.

            <p> 
                Soto Betawi is a rich and creamy beef soup, and a true comfort food for Jakartans.
                Unlike other Indonesian sotos, its broth is made with coconut milk (or sometimes fresh milk), giving it a distinctive, hearty flavor.
                It's filled with chunks of beef, offal, potatoes, and tomatoes, and usually served with rice, pickles, and a dash of lime.

            <img src="images/gado-gado.jpg" alt="Gado-Gado">
            <p>
                Gado-gado is an Indonesian salad of steamed vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, tofu, tempeh, and lontong (rice cakes), all drenched in a flavorful peanut sauce dressing.
                While found across Indonesia, the Jakarta version is famous for its perfectly balanced sweet, savory, and slightly spicy sauce, making it a healthy and delicious meal.
