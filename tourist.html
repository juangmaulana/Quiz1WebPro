        <h1> National Monument (Monas)</h1>
        <p> 
            The National Monument, or Monas, is the most iconic landmark of Jakarta, standing 132 meters tall in the center of Merdeka Square.
            It symbolizes the fight for Indonesia's independence. Visitors can take an elevator to the observation deck at the top for a stunning 360-degree view of the city skyline.
            The base of the monument houses a museum displaying dioramas of Indonesian history.

        <h1> Kota Tua (Old Town) </h1>
        <p>
            Kota Tua, the "Old Town" of Jakarta, is a historic district that was once the heart of the Dutch colonial empire in Asia.
            Today, you can walk or bike around Fatahillah Square, surrounded by beautifully preserved colonial-era buildings that now serve as museums, cafes, and art galleries.
            It's a perfect place to step back in time and experience the city's rich history.
